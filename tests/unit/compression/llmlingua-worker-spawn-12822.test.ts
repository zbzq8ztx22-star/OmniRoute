/**
 * Regression guard for #12822: the LLMLingua worker must actually spawn on Node.
 *
 * Root cause: `new Worker(pathToFileURL(file).href, ...)` passes a STRING. Node treats a
 * string argument as a filesystem path (it must start with ./ or ../), so a "file://..."
 * string is looked up literally and throws ERR_WORKER_PATH. Only a URL INSTANCE is
 * interpreted as a file: URL.
 *
 * Why it was invisible: pump() wraps ensureWorker() in `catch {}` and fails open, so the
 * spawn crash silently degraded every compression call to a passthrough instead of erroring.
 *
 * This test asserts the Node contract directly against a real Worker, so it fails on the
 * old `.href` spelling and passes on the URL object.
