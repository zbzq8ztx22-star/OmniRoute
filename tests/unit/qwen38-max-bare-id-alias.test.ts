/**
 * Bare `qwen3.8-max` was originally unroutable: the model shipped as
 * `qwen3.8-max-preview` (bailian-coding-plan, qoder, qwen-cloud-token-plan),
 * and nothing in the repo declared the short form. A client sending it therefore
 *
 *   1. missed MODEL_SPECS, so `getModelContextLimit()` fell through to the
 *      `default: 128000` in open-sse/services/contextManager.ts, and the chatCore
 *      preflight rejected any prompt above 128k with `context_length_exceeded`
 *      ("Input exceeds context window ... limit 128000") even though the real
 *      window is 1M; and
 *   2. would have been dispatched verbatim to the upstream, which only knows the
 *      `-preview` id.
 *
 * Both symptoms have one cause — the missing id — so the fix belongs in the
 * deprecation/rename alias map (`BUILT_IN_ALIASES`), which `resolveLifecycle()`
 * applies at open-sse/handlers/chatCore.ts:755, well before both the context
 * preflight and the upstream dispatch. A MODEL_SPECS `aliases` entry would have
 * fixed only (1): spec aliases resolve capabilities, never the dispatched id.
 *
 * SINCE THEN the premise has expired for GA-capable providers:
 * `qwen-cloud-token-plan` and `opencode-go` list the BARE id, so the rewrite that
 * rescues `qoder`/`bailian-coding-plan` would break those two. #14181 also gave
 * GA its own capability spec, distinct from preview. `resolveModelAlias`
 * already handles this — `hasKnownProviderModel` short-circuits the built-in alias
 * when the provider serves the id itself — which is why the alias map keeps the
 * entry rather than dropping it. The assertions below pin BOTH halves.
