// Regression test for the "⚠ Server did not respond within 60s" false alarm on a
// server that is actually healthy: `omniroute serve` printed the readiness-timeout
// diagnostic while the process went on to serve traffic normally.
//
// Cause: every probe of /api/monitoring/health was aborted after a FIXED 2s
// (`AbortSignal.timeout(2000)`), and a probe that times out is classified
// "hanging", which waitForServer refuses to count toward readiness (#6800).
// So whenever the first health response takes longer than 2s — a cold Windows
// boot where that route resolves ~10 dynamic imports and reads the DB — the poll
// can never succeed: each abort discards the in-flight request before the route
// finishes (so the route's own 1s payload cache is never populated either), and
// 500ms later a fresh probe restarts the same work into the same 2s ceiling, for
// the whole 60s budget. Same failure family as #10508, which fixed it by taking a
// DNS lookup out of that 2s budget rather than by widening the budget.
//
// Fix: escalate the per-probe timeout (2s → 4s → 8s → 15s) so a slow-but-real
// response is observed instead of aborted forever, clamped to the remaining
// budget so the total wait still honours the caller's timeout.
