/**
 * Process-local bounded admission for POST /v1/chat/completions.
 *
 * Large chat bodies amplify into multiple transient representations while they are parsed,
 * translated, compressed, and dispatched. A heap snapshot alone cannot prevent two healthy
 * requests from entering that allocation-heavy path together. This module reserves process-
 * local heavyweight capacity before parsing and enforces the hard limit against bytes read,
 * not an untrusted Content-Length header.
 *
 * Process-wide admission budget (#10110): ALL requests — every API key, every
 * session — contend for ONE global heavyweight budget, so the documented
 * "in one process" bound holds against fake-credential sharding. Per-request
 * session identity is used only as a fairness scheduling key: waiters are
 * grouped per session and served round-robin against the shared budget, so one
 * connection's burst cannot starve others (#9654).

 * happens asynchronously via `scheduleRefresh()` and is throttled by
 * `staleAfterMs`, so calling this on every admitted request does not add

 * milliseconds until the async refresh settles (or if the last real sample
 * merely went stale — `check()`'s own `maxStaleMs` fallback) — reporting that
 * stale "critical" label to callers that branch on severity (e.g. the queue
