/**
 * #12150 P2 surface 1 (the dominant transcript-retention leak): structured redaction of
 * video transcript fields on the CLIENT-REQUEST SNAPSHOT that lands in the detailed-log
 * artifact.
 *
 * `clientRawRequest.body` (src/sse/handlers/chat/clientRawRequest.ts::buildClientRawRequest)
 * is a bounded clone of the client's ORIGINAL request, captured BEFORE the guardrail chain
 * runs, and persisted verbatim by `reqLogger.logClientRawRequest`
 * (open-sse/handlers/chatCore.ts). Because it predates the video-bridge guardrail's own
 * description redaction (#12150 P1 — see `describeVideoPart`'s `descriptionRedacted` in
 * videoBridgeHelpers.ts), it still carries the client's raw `transcript` / `audioTranscript`
 * cue text on any video part. This module redacts THAT COPY ONLY: the body sent to the
 * provider and the response returned to the client are never touched here.
 *
 * Deliberately a standalone, dependency-light module — NOT part of videoBridgeHelpers.ts,
 * which pulls in the frame-extraction broker client, audio/video fusion, contact-sheet
 * composition and `sharp` for real video processing. The chat request hot path statically
 * imports whatever module owns the `logClientRawRequest` call site on every request
 * (video or not), so keeping this redaction free of that dependency chain matters for cold
 * start and blast radius.
 *
 * The field walk mirrors `extractVideoParts` (videoBridgeHelpers.ts): for each content part,
 * the candidate objects are the part itself, its `video_url` sub-object, and its `source`
 * sub-object (the same three checked there). Only video carrier parts are eligible: generic
 * text/audio metadata may also use fields named `transcript` or `audioTranscript`, and must
 * not be rewritten. Explicit video types remain eligible even with a malformed/empty ref,
 * so an observed request cannot retain their cue text merely because extraction rejected
 * that particular part. A video MIME on `source` covers the implicit video-source shape.
 * Redaction is a structured field substitution, not a scan over rendered text, so it cannot
 * be bypassed by adversarial cue content (see the discarded regex approach recorded in the
 * #12150 design doc, `_tasks/superpowers/specs/2026-09-01-video-transcript-retention-design.md`).
