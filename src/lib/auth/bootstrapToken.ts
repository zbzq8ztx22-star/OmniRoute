/**
 * One-shot fresh-install bootstrap token (#14296).
 *
 * Docker's port-forwarding NAT (and Docker Desktop's VM relay) changes the TCP
 * peer address the app sees inside the container — it is the docker0 bridge
 * gateway (e.g. 172.17.0.1), never 127.0.0.1 — so a container published with
 * `-p 20128:20128` cannot be told apart from an arbitrary remote caller by
 * peer address alone. Owner decision (2026-09-21): NEVER treat that gateway
 * peer as loopback — every external client arrives with the same peer, so
 * doing so would open the fresh-install bootstrap window (and the LOCAL_ONLY
 * spawn-capable route tier, Hard Rules #15/#17) to the whole internet.
 *
 * Instead, when a fresh install (no password / OIDC / INITIAL_PASSWORD /
 * session) sees a non-loopback caller try to complete onboarding, the server
 * mints a random, single-use token, prints it to the process/container log
 * (stdout — reachable only to whoever can already read the container's logs,
 * i.e. the operator), and accepts it as an alternate proof of "this is the
 * local operator" for exactly the two onboarding bootstrap writes
 * (`POST /api/settings/require-login`, `PATCH /api/settings` while still in
 * the bootstrap window). The token is invalidated the first time it is
 * successfully consumed.
 *
 * This module is a pure in-memory, per-process singleton — the token cannot
 * outlive the process, and a restart mints a fresh one, matching the
 * "wizard shows the log line, operator pastes it" flow it exists for.
