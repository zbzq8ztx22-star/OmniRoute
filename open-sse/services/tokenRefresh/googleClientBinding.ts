/**
 * Pick the OAuth client credentials a Google refresh must use.
 *
 * The marker lives in the connection's providerSpecificData.oauthClient:
 *   - a string starting with "custom:" records the LITERAL client id that
 *     issued the token. The refresh compares it against the currently
 *     configured client: matching means the operator's custom client is
 *     unchanged and can refresh; a mismatch (the operator swapped to a
 *     different custom client after authorization) or a missing/malformed
 *     marker means the connection predates per-connection binding or lost
 *     its issuer, so the embedded desktop client of the connection's own
 *     provider is the only client that can still own that token.
 *   - "builtin": authorized with the embedded desktop client.
 *
 * Storing the literal id (not just a boolean) matters because Google binds
 * each refresh token to the exact issuing client; "custom" alone would
 * silently move old connections onto a *different* custom client when the
 * operator rotates credentials.
 *
 * When no custom credentials are configured, both branches resolve to the
 * same built-in client and the choice is moot.
