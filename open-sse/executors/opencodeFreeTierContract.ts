/**
 * opencodeFreeTierContract.ts — the request contract OpenCode Zen's free tier enforces.
 *
 * Measured against the live endpoint on 2026-09-17, on three models and both the Chat
 * Completions and Responses surfaces: the upstream answers 403 FreeTierError unless the
 * request carries all four of
 *
 *   1. `stream: true` in the body,
 *   2. a non-empty `tools` array (the content is not inspected),
 *   3. a session header shaped `ses_` + 12 hex + 14 base62 (the shape is checked, the
 *      value is not — 12 arbitrary hex digits pass),
 *   4. a `User-Agent` carrying `opencode/<version>` with version >= 1.17 (an older
 *      version answers 426 UpgradeRequired rather than 403).
 *
 * Removing any single one of the four turns a 200 into a 403. Paid models on the same
 * host are not gated (a paid model without tools answers 401 CreditsError), which is why
 * `requiresFreeTierRequestContract` narrows the contract to free-tier models.
 *
 * The module also owns the free-model catalog — the catalog is what decides whether the
 * contract applies, so the two belong together and the executor imports them from here —
 * and the way back: the forced stream is rebuilt into a JSON body for a caller that asked
 * for JSON, reusing the shared event-stream parsers.
